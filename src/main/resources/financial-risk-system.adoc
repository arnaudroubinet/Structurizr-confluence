[#quality-attributes]
== Quality Attributes

[NOTE]
====
Cette section contient les attributs de qualité du système Financial Risk System, en utilisant le contenu original de Structurizr.
====

=== Performance
The Financial Risk System must be able to process large volumes of trading data and calculate risk metrics within defined time windows.

==== Performance Requirements
- *Response Time*: Risk calculations must complete within 30 seconds for standard portfolios
- *Throughput*: System must handle 10,000 transactions per minute during peak trading hours
- *Batch Processing*: End-of-day risk reports must complete within 4 hours

=== Scalability
The system must scale to accommodate growing trading volumes and expanding product lines.

==== Scalability Requirements
- *Horizontal Scaling*: Support for adding additional processing nodes
- *Data Volume*: Handle up to 100TB of historical trading data
- *User Load*: Support 500 concurrent users during peak hours

=== Availability
High availability is critical for real-time risk monitoring and reporting.

==== Availability Requirements
- *Uptime*: 99.9% availability during trading hours (6 AM - 8 PM EST)
- *Recovery Time*: Maximum 15 minutes recovery time for critical components
- *Data Backup*: Real-time replication to disaster recovery site

=== Security
The system handles sensitive financial data and must maintain strict security controls.

==== Security Requirements
- *Authentication*: Multi-factor authentication for all users
- *Authorization*: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- *Encryption*: All data encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256
- *Audit*: Complete audit trail of all system access and data modifications

[#architecture-decisions]
== Architecture Decision Records

=== ADR-001: Use Microservices Architecture

*Status*: Accepted +
*Date*: 2024-01-15 +
*Deciders*: Architecture Team

==== Context
The Financial Risk System requires high scalability and maintainability to handle complex risk calculations and growing business requirements.

==== Decision
We will implement a microservices architecture to decompose the system into smaller, independently deployable services.

==== Consequences
*Positive*:
- Independent scaling of components
- Technology diversity for optimal solutions
- Fault isolation

*Negative*:
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Distributed system challenges

=== ADR-002: Event-Driven Communication

*Status*: Accepted +
*Date*: 2024-01-20 +
*Deciders*: Architecture Team

==== Context
Microservices need to communicate efficiently while maintaining loose coupling.

==== Decision
Use event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka for inter-service communication.

==== Consequences
*Positive*:
- Loose coupling between services
- High throughput and scalability
- Event sourcing capabilities

*Negative*:
- Eventually consistent data
- Complex event ordering
- Additional infrastructure complexity

[#monitoring-observability]
== Monitoring and Observability

=== Key Metrics

The system tracks several critical metrics to ensure optimal performance:

- *Risk Calculation Latency*: P95 < 5 seconds
- *Data Processing Throughput*: > 50,000 messages/second
- *System Availability*: > 99.9% uptime
- *Error Rate*: < 0.1% of all transactions

=== Alerting Strategy

[#conclusion]
== Conclusion

The Financial Risk System architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for managing financial risk across the organization. The microservices approach enables independent scaling and technology choices while maintaining system cohesion through well-defined interfaces and event-driven communication.

Key benefits of this architecture include:

- *Scalability*: Independent scaling of risk calculation components
- *Maintainability*: Clear separation of concerns and bounded contexts
- *Observability*: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities
- *Security*: Multi-layered security controls and audit capabilities

The system is designed to evolve with changing business requirements while maintaining operational excellence and regulatory compliance.
